## A modern and flexible framework for flow cytometry data in R
`flowplyr` is a reimagined foundation for working with flow cytometry data in R — designed for modern data science workflows.  

It aims to make flow cytometry data accessible, composable, and fully compatible with the **tidyverse**, **functional programming**, and other R ecosystems, without forcing any particular paradigm.

## ✨ Key goals

- **Modern infrastructure** – a clean alternative to `flowCore` built on simple, transparent data structures.  
- **Functional and flexible** – `flowplyr` makes flow data accessible, so you can `purrr`, `dplyr`, `data.table`, or base R as you would any type of data.   
- **Interoperable design** – easily integrate your flow data analysis with your normal choice of downstream tools for visualization, modeling, saving, and reporting.
- **Unified data representation** – handles all fcs-file slots (i.e. *expression data* and *metadata*)

## 📦 Installation

*NB! `flowplyr` is under heavy development and subject to sweeping, rolling changes*

You can install the development version of `flowplyr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("hugoakerstrand/flowplyr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(flowplyr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
